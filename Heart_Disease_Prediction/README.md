## Heart Disease Prediction

Dataset Used -> **Heart Disease Dataset** from **[UCI repository of ML](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)**. You can also refer the data card from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/heart-disease-dataset)** as the data used in this project is directly downloaded from here.

Algorithm used -> **Dense Neural Network**

I used batch normalization, dropout and early stopping to solve the issue of overfitting.

The solution given in Keras tutorial [Structured data classification from scratch](https://keras.io/examples/structured_data/structured_data_classification_from_scratch/), which uses keras preprocessing layers has also been added.
