## About

* This repository contains projects, solved using **Neural Networks**. 

* Aim of this repository is to learn basics of neural networks, how to define, train, evaluate and optimize them. I will also explore some popular deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow, Keras and Pytorch.

* Dataset sources will be mentioned in the README files of individual projects

Feel free to collaborate or suggest any interesting project/Dataset.
